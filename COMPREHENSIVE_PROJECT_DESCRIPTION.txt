The application showcases industrial-grade features including real-time data visualization, machine status monitoring, predictive maintenance algorithms, user authentication, and comprehensive analytics dashboards.

## PROJECT ARCHITECTURE AND TECHNICAL FOUNDATION

### Backend Infrastructure

The backend is built upon Flask (Python 3.x), providing a lightweight yet powerful web application framework. The architecture follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern with clear separation of concerns:

**Core Application Structure:**
- `app.py`: Main application entry point with Flask configuration, background task management, and request routing
- `models.py`: Database abstraction layer with MongoDB integration, data models, and business logic
- `controllers.py`: Business logic layer handling data processing, authentication, and API endpoints
- `routes.py`: URL routing and endpoint definitions with RESTful API implementation
- `views.py` & `views_new.py`: Template rendering logic with context data preparation
- `config.py`: Centralized configuration management with environment-specific settings

**Database Architecture:**
The system utilizes MongoDB as its primary database, chosen for its flexibility in handling semi-structured IoT sensor data and scalability requirements. The database architecture includes:

- **Processes Collection**: Stores the six tea processing stages with metadata
- **Machines Collection**: Contains detailed machine specifications, current status, and operational parameters
- **Readings Collection**: Time-series sensor data from all machines with timestamp indexing
- **Users Collection**: Authentication and user management data
- **Process-Specific Collections**: Separate collections for each processing stage (withering_data, rolling_data, fermentation_data, drying_data, sorting_data, packing_data)

The system implements a dual-database strategy with primary cloud MongoDB (MongoDB Atlas) and local fallback capability, ensuring high availability and resilience against network connectivity issues.
